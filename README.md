# Svenska Badplatser // Swedish Bathing Sites
Webiste showing government maintained beaches in Sweden and their ratings and, when available, their latest safety assesments.

They are color coded:

- GREY shows the values haven't been updated in the last 3 months.
- RED shows that either the classification is poor or the bacteria-levels are too high and bathing is NOT recommended.
- YELLOW shows that either the classification is medium or the bacteria-levels are heightened. Bathing is likely allowed but check the local government website for more information.
- GREEN shows that the site was controllled within the last 3 months and no dangerous levels of bacteria or algae was measured at the times.

This website only displays information made available by the government. Deciding to swim at any location, and any risk incurred, is your sole responsibility.
